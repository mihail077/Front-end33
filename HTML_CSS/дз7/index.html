        <b>Ludwig van Beethoven</b>[n 1] (baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827)
     was a German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers
      in the history of Western music; his works rank among the most performed of the classical 
      music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era
       in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and 
       late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered
        to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual 
        development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes
         characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late
          period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.

        <b>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b>>[a][b] (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) was a prolific and
         influential composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, his rapid
          pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every genre of his
           time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic,
            concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded
             as among the greatest composers in the history of Western music,[1] with his music
              admired for its "melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and
               texture".[2]

        <b>Johann Sebastian Bach</b>[n 2] (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German
         composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He is known for his orchestral music 
         such as the Brandenburg Concertos; instrumental compositions such as the Cello Suites;
          keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works
           such as the Schubler Chorales and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and vocal music such
            as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach revival,
             he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western
              music.[2][3]

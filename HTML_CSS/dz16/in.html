    A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS
     from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.
There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most
 CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS,
  such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These 
  features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.
To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web
 server; Or use the CSS preprocessor to compile on the development environment,
  and then upload compiled CSS file to the web server.

    Less (Leaner Style Sheets; sometimes stylized as LESS) is a dynamic preprocessor
     style sheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
     run on the client side or server side.[2] Designed by Alexis Sellier, Less is
      influenced by Sass and has influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which 
      adapted its CSS-like block formatting syntax.[3] Less is an open source project. 
      Its first version was written in Ruby; however, in the later versions, use of
       Ruby has been deprecated and replaced by JavaScript. The indented syntax of Less 
       is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid Less code with the same semantics.
        Less provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, operators and
         functions; the main difference between Less and other CSS precompilers is that
          Less allows real-time compilation via less.js by the browser.[2][4]
